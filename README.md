## Introduction
Hole Filling with Texture Synthesis is an advanced image processing project that aims to restore images by filling in missing or damaged regions. The project leverages texture synthesis techniques and dynamic programming to create realistic and seamless textures that are used to fill the holes in the original images.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (recommended version 3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV library (cv2)
- NumPy library (numpy)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

1. Place the original image with a hole and the texture image in the project folder.

2. Open the `main.py` file in a text editor and update the file names for `img_path` and `texture_path` variables with the appropriate file names.

3. Customize the `rec_around_birds` and `rec_around_human` lists to define the regions to fill for the respective images.

4. Set the `patch_size` and `common_size` variables to control the size of patches and the overlapping region.

5. Save the `main.py` file and run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will generate two output images, named `res15.jpg` and `res16.jpg`, with the holes filled using texture synthesis.

## Method Overview

The project employs texture synthesis to address hole filling in images. The algorithm follows these key steps:

1. **Hole Detection:** Identify the regions in the original image that require filling.

2. **Texture Analysis:** Analyze the texture information of the surrounding pixels outside the hole. Extract features and statistics to characterize the texture.

3. **Texture Synthesis:** Generate a new texture that matches the statistics of the surrounding region using an MRF-based texture synthesis algorithm. The synthesized texture should be seamless and blend well with the existing content.

4. **Texture Completion:** Use the synthesized texture to fill the hole in the original image. Ensure that the transition between the synthesized region and the existing content is smooth and visually pleasing.

To enhance the realism of the filled regions, the project introduces dynamic programming techniques. Dynamic programming minimizes an objective function, which considers the similarity between the filled region and the surrounding context. By optimizing the boundary pixels of the filled region, the algorithm achieves smoother transitions and reduces artifacts.

## Results

The script generates the final output images with the holes filled using texture synthesis. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in restoring images with missing regions.
